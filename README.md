# CommandPatternRealization
The very simple Command Pattern Realization in Unity


Click on the cubes to change their size for a number of times.


After it you can :
1) rewind all changes by clicling "Rewind"
2) play changes you've made in sequence that you clicked on them by clicking "Done" and "Play"
3) reset buffer with all commands and try again
